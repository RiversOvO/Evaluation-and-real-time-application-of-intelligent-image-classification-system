# Evaluation-and-real-time-application-of-intelligent-image-classification-system
Project background:

This project aims to evaluate the performance of different classification algorithms on image classification tasks. In order to enhance the practical application value, the project also realizes the real-time camera image classification function.
Enables the system to process and classify images captured by the camera in real time.

Our Job:

路 Use K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB) and convolutional neural network (VGG) to count CIFAR-10
Perform training and testing on the data set

路 Evaluate and compare model performance according to calculation time, confusion matrix, accuracy, accuracy, recall, F1 value and other indicators, optimize hyperparameters for cross-validation

路 Use a visual interface to display classification results and performance indicators

路 Realized the real-time camera image classification function, used OpenCV for camera capture, and classified and displayed real-time images through the trained VGG model
It improves the practicability and interactivity of the application
